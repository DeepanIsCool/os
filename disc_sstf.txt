Disk Scheduling - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

Read number of disk requests from the user
Read all request positions
Read initial head position
Mark all requests as unvisited
Start from initial head position
While there are unvisited requests, find the unvisited request closest to current head position
Calculate distance for all unvisited requests and select the one with minimum distance
Mark that request as visited
Add the distance to total head movement
Move head to that request position
Continue until all requests are visited
Display the order of disk head movement
Display total head movement
