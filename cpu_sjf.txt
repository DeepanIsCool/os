CPU Scheduling - SJF (Shortest Job First)

Read number of processes from the user
Read burst time for each process
Sort all processes in ascending order of burst time
Set waiting time of first process as zero
Calculate completion time of first process as its burst time
Calculate turnaround time of first process as its completion time
For each subsequent process, calculate waiting time as sum of previous waiting time and previous burst time
Calculate completion time as sum of previous completion time and current burst time
Calculate turnaround time as sum of waiting time and burst time
Display process details with burst time, waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time
Calculate and display average waiting time and average turnaround time
